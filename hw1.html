   <p id="p1">Problem 1: Identify which of the following are valid Javascript types (i.e. can be returned as output from the typeof() function). For each valid type provide an example using console.log(typeof( ... )).<p>
       function, boolean, number, object, undefined and string are valid javascript types</p>
    <script>
        var a=function f(){return function b(){return 3};}
        console.log(typeof(a))//function
        console.log(typeof(true))//boolean
        console.log(typeof (32))//number
        console.log(typeof('split'))//string
        console.log(typeof(dece))//undefined
        console.log(typeof([1,2,3]))//object
      
    </script>
    </p>
    <p id="p2">Problem 2: Each of the following expressions contains improper JSON: calling JSON.parse(...) will result in an error. For each example, describe the error and provide a fixed version. Use the JSON.parse function to demonstrate that it works. Some may contain more than one error.
       <p>a: the key name should has double quotation<br> b: there should not have comment <br> c: should be comma between each brace, there should have bracket in the end of expression</p>
        <script>
            JSON.parse('{"name" : "Data-driven web applications"}')
            JSON.parse('{  "number": 3300 }')
            JSON.parse('[{ "name": "DDWA", "number": 3300 } ,{ "name": "Java", "number" : 2110 } ,{ "name": "Python", "number" :1110 }]')
        </script>
    </p>
    <p id="p3">Problem 3: Write a JSON expression that represents a list. This list should contain at least three objects. Each object should have at least three properties. The value of one
property should be a number, the value of another should be a boolean, and value of a third should be a list of strings. You may define the contents in any way you choose and add additional properties as long as we can easily verify that the required elements are present. <p>
       JSON expression: [{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]},{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]},{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]}]</p>
        <script>
            var obj= [{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]},{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]},{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]}]
            JSON.parse('[{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]},{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]},{"p1":7,"p2":true,"p3":["father","mother"]}]')
        </script>
    </p>
<p id="p4">Problem 4: Describe, in your own words, the course policy on late and unreadable work outlined in the syllabus, which is linked from the course website. (10 pts)
     <p>
